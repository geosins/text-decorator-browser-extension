This is a browser extension from SberMarket [frontend meetup](https://youtu.be/-glbRXbIAGM?t=4648). It can modify text color on any pages by inputed selector.  

It has been bootstrapped with [`plasmo init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plasmo), using [Plasmo Framework](https://docs.plasmo.com/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.
